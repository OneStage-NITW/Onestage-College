		<p>Historically, the differently abled have been denied fundamental rights. The twentieth century signalled a turning point.But,despite the great strides made towards empowering the differently abled, they continue to face major problems due to social stigma and difficulty in accepting their disabilities.</p>

		<p>The struggles of the specially abled are a heart wrenching sight.Some people still believe that disabilities are a result of bad karma. In India,the differently abled are disowned by their families and denied admissions into schools.Hence,they have no means to horne their talents.Malls,Movie Theatres,Parks and other pblic places aren’t suitably equipped for their easy movement. The differently abled are often scorned and looked down upon irrespective of the various other talents they possess.</p>

		<p>We felt the need to empower the differently abled to achieve their full potential while sensitizing the general public about them.Being fortunate enough to be fully abled,it is our duty to help the less privileged.It was this and our belief in the motto “No disability can hinder true talent”,that brought us together for our project,OneStage.A one of a kind initiative,OneStage saw its inception in 2012,as a talent platform in SpringSpree,the annual cultural festival of NIT Warangal,a premier engineering institute of India.The title OneStage was selected to emphasize the fact that the stage was open for all,irrespective of their disabilities.We had performances by the members of four organizations.The performances were spectacular and the donations received significant.This inspired us to take OneStage to a higher level.Today,OneStage strives to address the problems of the differently abled in various ways.</p>
